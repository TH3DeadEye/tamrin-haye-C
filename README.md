## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide practical examples and solutions to C programming problems. These exercises were part of the final exam questions from my previous C programming course. The exercises cover a variety of topics, including basic concepts, data structures, and more advanced programming techniques. Each exercise is presented as a question followed by its answer.

## Features

- Solutions to a wide range of C programming exercises.
- Well-commented code for better understanding.
- Organized folder structure for easy navigation.
- Ideal for self-learning and reference.

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks)
- Basic understanding of the C programming language

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone and use the repository on your local machine:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TH3DeadEye/tamrin-haye-C.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd tamrin-haye-C
   ```

## Usage

1. Browse through the directories to find the desired exercise or assignment.
2. Open the `main.c` file in your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o main
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
5. Follow the prompts or examine the output to understand the solution.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by questions and their corresponding answers, with folder names written in Finglish (Persian written in English script) to reflect the question directly. Each folder contains a `main.c` file that includes the solution to the question. You can navigate the folders based on your specific interest or topic:

```
.
├── soal1
│   └── main.c
├── soal2
│   └── main.c
├── soal3
│   └── main.c
├── ...
└── README.md
```
or 
```
.
├── question1
│   └── main.c
├── question2
│   └── main.c
├── question3
│   └── main.c
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific question, and the `main.c` file contains both the problem statement and its solution.
